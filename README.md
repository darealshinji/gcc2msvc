gcc2msvc
========

This program is a wrapper for msvc's cl.exe and intended to be used with Windows 10's "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" shell.
It is invoked with gcc options (only a limited number) and turns them into msvc options to call cl.exe.
The msvc options may not exactly do the same as their gcc counterparts.

See [wrapmsvc](https://github.com/darealshinji/wrapmsvc) for a similar project.
